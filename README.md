# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-Scratch-

In this repo, I will be building machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. I will be using datasets from either Kaggle or other data source to show how these algorithms work. The goal is to work through some of these algorithms in a step by step manner without using machine learning library, like scikit-learn, in Python. 

Some of the algorithms I will be building include:

* Decision Tree 
* Random Forest 
* Logistic Regression 
* Linear Regression (Lasso & Ridge) 
* K-Means 
* DBSCAN 

I will add more algorithms as I deem fit.
